The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.44.1.
Rust is a programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust 1.44.1 is as easy as:

```console
$ rustup update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get `rustup`][install] from the
appropriate page on our website.
