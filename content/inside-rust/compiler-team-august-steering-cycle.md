On [Friday, July 30th][jul-30-zulip-archive], the Rust Compiler team had a planning meeting for the August steering cycle.

[jul-30-zulip-archive]: https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/238009tcompilermeetings/86722planningmeeting20210730.html

Every fourth Friday, the Rust compiler team decides how
it is going to use its scheduled steering and design meeting time over the next
three Fridays.

On [Friday, 20 August][aug-20-mtg], we will be having a meeting to
discuss how to increase the number of reviewers available to handle the review queue load.

[aug-20-mtg]: https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/446

Each meeting will run from 2pm to 3pm GMT, and will take place on the
[T-compiler/meetings zulip stream][zulip].
