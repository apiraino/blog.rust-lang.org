The core team has had a few membership updates in the last month, and we wanted to provide an update.

To start, Florian Gilcher is joining the Core team as a full member. Florian has been attending meetings as an observer since March 2019. He is the lead of the Community Events team, and has done a lot of work in the open source world, with plenty of insight to offer especially as we look to form a Rust Foundation.

There are also two folks stepping back from the team. Carol Nichols has been a member of the team for three years, and she is stepping back to make more time for other projects in the community, including crates.io and her continued work on the Rust book. Nick Cameron [has recently welcomed a second child](https://www.ncameron.org/blog/leaving-the-rust-core-team/) (congratulations!) and is leaving the core team to be able to focus more on his family and his work at PingCAP. He will continue to be around in the Rust community. Thanks to both Carol and Nick for their hard work over the years — we’ll miss you!
