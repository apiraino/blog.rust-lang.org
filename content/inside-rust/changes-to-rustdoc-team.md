Recently, there have been a lot of improvements in rustdoc. It was possible thanks to our new contributors. In light of these recent contributions, a few changes were made in the rustdoc team.

## Adding a new team leader

[Jynn](https://github.com/jyn514) has been helping me **a lot** on the leading parts by tagging issues and mentoring newcomers. But at the same time, they initiated great changes in the rustdoc codebase that led to huge performance improvements, they finished the "intra doc link" features which is now stable after years of instability (more information [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/write-documentation/linking-to-items-by-name.html)). They also did multiple additional things but let's stop the listing here. :)

Overall, they've been an enormous help and making them co-lead is just making official everything's they've been doing since they joined the rustdoc team (and even before!). I'm glad to have them on the team and as co-lead.

## Membership Changes

In addition to the new co-leadership nomination, we also have some new rustdoc team members to announce: [**@camelid**] and [**@Nemo157**].

[**@camelid**] did a huge number of contributions on rustdoc, helping on the cleanup and fixing bugs.

[**@Nemo157**] helped a lot on the "front-end" part of rustdoc (i.e. HTML/CSS/JS), not only reviewing but also fixing bugs and improving the current code.

Both of them have been contributing for a long time and we're really glad to (finally) have them on board.

## Conclusion

With all these great new onboardings, we're expecting rustdoc to improve at much faster rate. More to come soon!
