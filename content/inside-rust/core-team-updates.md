Niko Matsakis is [stepping back][niko-blog] from the [Core Team][team-core],
focusing his energy on leading the [Language Team][team-lang]. Amongst the many
things he has done for the Rust project over the years, Niko has been part of
the Core Team since the beginning, and had a key role in shaping Rust’s
governance. We’re all excited to see what his new focus is going to bring!

Thanks Niko!
