Please welcome [Dan Gohman](https://github.com/sunfishcode) to the
[Library Contributors](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/library#libs-contributors) group!

You might know Dan from his work on
[Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/), WASI, the recent [I/O Safety RFC](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3128-io-safety.html),
[cap-std](https://crates.io/crates/cap-std), [rustix](https://crates.io/crates/rustix),
or one of his many (often WASI or I/O related) contributions to the Rust standard library.

Congratulations Dan, and thanks for everything you do!
