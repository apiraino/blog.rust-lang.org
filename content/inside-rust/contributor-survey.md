You may be aware that [Rust recently turned 5][five]! If you read this blog,
then you probably already know that the Rust project thrives because of its
many contributors, and that we're always looking for ways to make it easier for
people to get involved.

[five]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/05/15/five-years-of-rust.html

Today we are pleased to announce the [Rust contributor survey][survey]. This
short, anonymous survey should only take a few minutes to fill out, but it will
really help us in understanding what kinds of problems people experience when
contributing to Rust so that we can try to address them. We value many
different kinds of contributions, such as reporting problems, triaging issues,
organizing meetups, etc, but this survey's purpose is to identify and eliminate
barriers to entry for code contributions.

The survey is targeting current, past, and future contributors to Rust. We're
particularly interested in hearing from *new or prospective code contributors*.

So whether you're a frequent contributor already or someone who has only
thought about contributing, please take a few minutes to [fill out the
survey][survey] before **June 10, 2020**.

We plan to share and discuss summary data. We may quote free-form responses
unless you ask us not to. All information is collected anonymously. Only team
members or people specifically helping administer the survey will be able to
view full results.
