I'm happy to announce some changes in the leadership of the crates.io
team. Justin Geibel ([jtgeibel]) will be joining me as co-lead. Justin
will be replacing Ashley Williams, who has been very busy lately with
other commitments.

Justin has been involved in the crates.io team since the summer
of 2017. In addition to general "gardening" tasks (Justin has [over
140 PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pulls/jtgeibel) to the
crates.io repo!), he has made a number of improvements and changes:

* Refactoring of error handling logic and the test harness
* CI improvements to caching behavior and build times
* Added a boot time option to use hyper as the web server, with the goal of eventually switching over in production

Please join me in extending a sincere congratulations üéâ to Justin, as
well as a big thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è to Ashley for all of the work she did
as co-lead of the team thus far.
