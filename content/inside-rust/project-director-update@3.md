This is the fourth blog post in [the series started December
2024](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2024/12/17/project-director-update.html) where us Rust
Foundation Project Directors will be sharing the highlights from last month’s Rust Foundation Board
meeting. You’ll find the [full February 2025
minutes](https://rustfoundation.org/resource/february-2025-board-meeting/) on the Rust Foundation’s
site!

Highlights from the February meeting include:

* It was Eli Gild’s first meeting; he’s the new Member Director for Google replacing Lars Bergstrom.
* Paul Lenz, the Foundation’s Director of Finance & Funding, announced he’s planning to retire at
  the end of September. The Foundation is considering creating a slightly different role on the
  senior management team and will be getting feedback from project leadership before starting the
  recruitment process.
* The Foundation presented the 2025 budget, which was a “business as usual” budget without any
  large changes from previous years. The board approved the budget.
* Gracie announced the Foundation is planning on increasing its social media presence on Mastodon
  and Bluesky in the near future.
* RustConf 2025’s location and dates were announced, and the RustConf team is looking at non-US
  venues for RustConf 2026.
* Project Director Ryan Levick was elected Vice Chair of the Board. Congrats, Ryan!
