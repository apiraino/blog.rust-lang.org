This is the third blog post in [the series started December 2024](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2024/12/17/project-director-update.html) where us Rust Foundation Project Directors will be sharing the highlights from last month’s Rust Foundation Board meeting. You’ll find the [full January 2025 meeting minutes](https://rustfoundation.org/resource/january-2025-board-meeting/) on the Rust Foundation’s [beautiful new site](https://rustfoundation.org/policies-resources/#minutes)!

Highlights from the January meeting include:

* [Nell Shamrell-Harrington was unanimously elected as the new Chair of the Board](https://rustfoundation.org/media/nell-shamrell-harrington-elected-as-rust-foundation-board-of-directors-chair/)! While she’s currently Microsoft’s representative to the board, she’s been a longstanding active member of the Rust community as an editor of [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/), among many other things. We’re looking forward to working with Nell in her new role!
* Because Nell was Vice-Chair, there’s now a vacancy and will be an election for that position in February’s board meeting.
* Rust Foundation Executive Director and CEO Rebecca Rumbul has been hearing interest in a Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Rust from a variety of folks, so she’s starting to explore coordinating discussions of the possibilities in this space. These discussions are in very early stages, and the conversations will include companies that use Rust as well as the Rust Project.
* There is an ongoing effort to make our CI more cost effective by refactoring workflows to run on free GitHub Actions runners, with promising results. Further details forthcoming in the coming months.

As always, if you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, please
