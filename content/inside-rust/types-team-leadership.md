It is my great privilege to announce that [lcnr][] will be serving as the new types team co-lead. The types team has adopted the ["rolling leadership" model](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3262-compiler-team-rolling-leads.html) pioneered by the compiler team, and so [lcnr][] is joining as the new "junior lead". The senior lead will be [Jack Huey][]. I ([Niko Matsakis][]) am going to be stepping back and I will continue to be active as a types team member.

Over the years [lcnr][] has made numerous contributions to Rust, beginning with a focus on const generics but soon stepping over to the trait solver and type system. Their most recent contribution has been leading the push for a new trait solver. This work recently came to its first major milestone, [stabilizing the new solver for use in coherence][#121848]. This was a major goal for the types team and [lcnr][] deserves a lot of credit for it, as well as [compiler-errors][] and [boxy][].
