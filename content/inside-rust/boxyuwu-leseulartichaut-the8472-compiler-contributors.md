Please welcome [Boxy], [Léo Lanteri Thauvin] and [the8472] to the [compiler-contributors] group!

[Boxy] has been working on pushing const generics forward by [implementing parts] of the `const_evaluatable_checked` feature, [fixing bugs] and [making rustdoc work with const generics].
Boxy is also a frequent contributor to [#project-const-generics] discussions and meetings.

[Léo Lanteri Thauvin] has been a consistent contributor of [refactorings and improvements] to rustc.
Recently, Léo has been [implementing] a [Major Change Proposal] to migrate the `unsafe` checker to operate on THIR instead of MIR.

[the8472] has been a frequent contributor of performance improvements to both the [compiler itself] as well as the [standard library]. 
[the8472] can also be frequently found on Zulip offering advice and help.

Congratulations [Boxy], [Léo Lanteri Thauvin] and [the8472] and thanks!
