This is the sixth blog post in [the series started December
2024](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2024/12/17/project-director-update.html) where us Rust
Foundation Project Directors share the highlights from previous months’ Rust Foundation Board
meeting(s). You may have noticed that the last time I posted was April and it is now July! I forgot
to post in May for April’s meeting, then May’s board meeting was cancelled due to RustNL/Rust Week.
So this post will cover [April’s
meeting](https://rustfoundation.org/resource/april-2025-board-meeting/) and [June’s
meeting](https://rustfoundation.org/resource/june-2025-board-meeting/); apologies for my tardiness.

April meeting highlights include:

- The Foundation proposed raising Platinum Member fees, for a future board vote.
- [Ferrous Systems donated the Ferrocene Language Specification to the Rust
  Project](https://rustfoundation.org/media/ferrous-systems-donates-ferrocene-language-specification-to-rust-project/).
- The RustConf 2025 CFP was opened, and discussions on a venue for RustConf 2026 were in progress.

June meeting highlights include:

- The Foundation has published a [position statement on Rust and
  AI](https://rustfoundation.org/resource/rust-and-ai-position-statement/).
- The Foundation will be gathering input from the Rust Project to inform the Foundation’s
  strategy for 2026-28.
- The Foundation secured continued funding from [Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/) and the
  [Sovereign Tech Agency](https://www.sovereign.tech/), but general economic uncertainty has caused
  some Silver members to choose not to renew. The Foundation is always looking for
  [more member companies](https://rustfoundation.org/get-involved/)!
- The Board voted to approve an increase in the Platinum Member fees from $300,000/year to $325,000/year.

As always, if you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, please
