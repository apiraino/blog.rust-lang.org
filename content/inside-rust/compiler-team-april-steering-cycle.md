On [Friday, April 9th][apr-9-zulip-archive], the Rust Compiler team had a planning meeting for the April steering cycle.

[apr-9-zulip-archive]: https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/238009tcompilermeetings/96901planningmeeting20210409.html

Every fourth Friday, the Rust compiler team decides how
it is going to use its scheduled steering and design meeting time over the next
three Fridays.

On Friday, 23 April 2021, we will be having a meeting to discuss a
set of proposed [guiding principles][] for compiler contributors.

On Friday, 30 April 2021, we will be having a meeting to discuss the
process used for weekly compiler [performance triage][].

[performance triage]: https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/400

Both meetings will run from 2pm to 3pm GMT, and will take place on the
[T-compiler/meetings zulip stream][zulip].

(Also: we neglected to post an announcement at the outset of the March steering
cycle. In March we had two meetings: the first was a [retrospective][] on the
memshrink development sprint that we had over the first week of March, and the
second was a meeting to [discuss][musl-discussion] the static vs dynamic linking
defaults for our musl libc targets.)
