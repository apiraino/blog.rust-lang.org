As part of [ongoing work on governance](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2022/10/06/governance-update.html), the "leadership chat" established a smaller "governance reform" working group to create an RFC to establish new project wide governance. This RFC is now live and can found on the RFCs repo: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3392>

We have set up a [Zulip stream](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/369838-rfc-leadership-council-feedback) to provide an additional dedicated place for feedback on the RFC. In addition, team leads will be asking their respective teams for feedback directly. However, anyone is welcome to participate and provide feedback directly in the Zulip stream or the RFC PR if they prefer.

Again, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.
