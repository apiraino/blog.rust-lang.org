The rustup working group is happy to announce the release of rustup version 1.24.2. [Rustup][install] is the recommended tool to install [Rust][rust], a programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.

If you have a previous version of rustup installed, getting rustup 1.24.2 is as easy as closing your IDE and running:

```
rustup self update
```

Rustup will also automatically update itself at the end of a normal toolchain update:

```
rustup update
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get rustup][install] from the appropriate page on our website.

[install]: https://rustup.rs

## What's new in rustup 1.24.2

1.24.2 introduces pooled allocations to prevent memory fragmentation issues on
some platforms with 1.24.x. We're not entirely sure what aspect of the streamed
unpacking logic caused allocator fragmentation, but memory pools are a well
known fix that should solve this for all platforms.

Those who were encountering CI issues with 1.24.1 should find them resolved.

### Other changes

You can check out all the changes to Rustup for 1.24.2 in the [changelog]!

Rustup's documentation is also available in [the rustup book][book].

excellent contributions.
