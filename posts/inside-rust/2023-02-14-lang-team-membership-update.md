We are happy to announce that [Tyler Mandry][tmandry] is joining the Rust language design team as a full member!

[tmandry]: https://github.com/tmandry

Tyler has been driving the design of async functions in traits over the last year. In that process Tyler has authored two RFCs, [#3185 (static async functions in traits)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3185) and [#3245 (refined trait impls)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3245), both of which were accepted. He has good instincts for language design and orthogonality, devising general solutions to address a range of use cases with a small set of language changes, such as [contexts/capabilities](https://tmandry.gitlab.io/blog/posts/2021-12-21-context-capabilities/) and [`dyn*`](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2022/03/29/dyn-can-we-make-dyn-sized/).

Tyler is also a strong implementor. He was a past contributor to the chalk project and understands the intricacies of the trait and type system quite well. He also implemented a number of improvements to async Rust, such as work to reduce the size of futures.

Throughout his work on Rust, Tyler has demonstrated his ability to drive discussions towards consensus on a number of occasions. For example, he helped to navigate questions around boxing and auto-traits. He always makes an effort to understand people's points, even when he disagrees with their conclusions.

Welcome to the team, Tyler!
