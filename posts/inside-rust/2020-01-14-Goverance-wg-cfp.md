Hello everyone! 

On Tuesday 14 January the working group met and discussed the RFC 
https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/project-wg-rfc-next/draft-rfcs/working-group-terminology.md.

## Project groups

You can see the [detailed minutes] on the [wg-governance] repository, but here is a quick summary: 

*Decision for specifics of working group creation is to remain with what was described in https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/enabling-the-formation-of-new-working-groups/10218
*Group status will be Active or Archived
*Future work will be done to lighten the RFC process (an issue has been submitted)
*A project group lifecycle chart was created and a flowchart based on this will be integrated in the RFC


## Next meeting

Our next meeting will be 28 January 2020. We will discuss the status of the project groups RFC for no more than 15 minutes,
and then focus on reviewing action items from the meeting of December 3rd.
