Please welcome Thom Chiovoloni and Chris Denton to the
[Library Contributors](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/library#libs-contributors) group!

[Thom](https://github.com/thomcc) has been working on various improvements to the implementation
of the standard library, such as [optimizing `io::Error`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87869),
[optimizing `Chars::count`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/90414), and has been helping out
with reviewing various implementation changes.

[Chris](https://github.com/ChrisDenton/) has been focusing on the Windows specific parts of the standard library.
Chris implemented the Windows part of the patch for [CVE-2022-21658](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/01/20/cve-2022-21658.html),
and has done [a ton of work](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Achrisdenton+is%3Aclosed)
to improve the Windows side of `std::fs`, `std::path`, `std::process` and other modules.

Congratulations Thom and Chris, and thanks for everything you do!
