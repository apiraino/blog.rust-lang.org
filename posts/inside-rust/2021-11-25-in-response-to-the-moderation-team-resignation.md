As top-level team leads, project directors to the Foundation, and core team
members, we are actively collaborating to establish next steps after the
statement from the Rust moderation team.

While we are having ongoing conversations to share perspectives on the
situation, we'd like to collectively state that we are all committed to the
continuity and long term health of the project.

Updates on next steps will be shared with the project and wider community over
the next few weeks. In the meantime, we are grateful to the interim moderators
who have stepped up to provide moderation continuity to the project.
