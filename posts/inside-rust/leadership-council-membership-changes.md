As of today, Khionu Sybiern will no longer be the representative of the Moderation team on the
Leadership Council, and she is also stepping down from the Moderation Team entirely, for personal
reasons. She hopes to return to contributing in the future. Josh Gould will be joining the
Leadership Council as the Moderation Team representative.

We thank Khionu for her extensive time and incredibly important contributions to the Moderation
Team and the Leadership Council. We wish her the best, and that she returns to the Rust community
when she's ready. We thank Josh for being able to fill the Leadership Council role and look forward
to working with them!

We had already begun working on growing the essential Moderation Team before; because of that and
Khio stepping down, we are also pleased to announce that Oliver Scherer (oli-obk) has joined the
Moderation Team. Please join us in welcoming Oli!
