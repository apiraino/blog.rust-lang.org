# Relnotes PR and release blog post ping group is now available

A new [`relnotes-interest-group`][relnotes-ping-group] ping group is now available for contributors to join to get pinged when a new relnotes PR (to <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust>) or release blog post (to <https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org>) are created. Ping group members may wish to be pinged so that they can help with:

- Reviewing wording of the release notes PR or blog post
- Checking if certain release notes entries are unnecessary, redundant, or missing (especially on behalf of their respective team(s))
- Recommending other improvements

This ping group is primarily intended for project members. If you wish to join the ping group, you may follow the usual procedure to send a PR to <https://github.com/rust-lang/team> and add yourself as a member of [`teams/relnotes-interest-group.toml`](https://github.com/rust-lang/team/blob/master/teams/relnotes-interest-group.toml).
