This survey is aimed at gathering information about the community of users who use the Rust Programming Language
for Embedded Systems, including on microcontrollers. It is being run as a [Micro Survey], run by the same
Rust Survey Team responsible for the [Annual Rust Survey]. The survey is only offered in the English language.

We invite you to take this survey even if you have only just begun with Rust on Embedded Systems,
or have only experimented with it informally. Your responses will help us gather data over time towards
the adoption of Rust for these systems.

Please help us spread the word by sharing the [survey link][2024 Embedded Community Micro Survey] via your social networks,
at meetups, with colleagues, and in any other community that makes sense to you.

This survey would not be possible without the time, resources, and attention of members of the Survey Team,
the Embedded Working Group, the Rust Foundation, and other collaborators. Thank you!

We appreciate your participation!
