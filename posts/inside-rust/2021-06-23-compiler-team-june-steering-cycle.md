On [Friday, June 4th][jun-4-zulip-archive], the Rust Compiler team had a planning meeting for the June steering cycle.

[jun-4-zulip-archive]: https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/238009tcompilermeetings/93506planningmeeting20210604.html

Every fourth Friday, the Rust compiler team decides how
it is going to use its scheduled steering and design meeting time over the next
three Fridays.

On [Friday, 25 June][jun-25-mtg], we will be having a meeting to review a
document discussing the incremental compilation fingerprint issue that led to
the emergency 1.52.1 release, and the steps the project is taking to prevent
future occurrences of similar scenarios. (This date is a change in schedule from
its original date that had been discussed in the planning meeting.)

[jun-25-mtg]: https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/435

The meeting will run from 2pm to 3pm GMT, and will take place on the
[T-compiler/meetings zulip stream][zulip].
