The rustup working group is happy to announce the release of rustup version 1.24.1. [Rustup][install] is the recommended tool to install [Rust][rust], a programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.

If you have a previous version of rustup installed, getting rustup 1.24.1 is as easy as closing your IDE and running:

```
rustup self update
```

Rustup will also automatically update itself at the end of a normal toolchain update:

```
rustup update
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get rustup][install] from the appropriate page on our website.

[install]: https://rustup.rs

## What's new in rustup 1.24.1

Firstly, if you have not read the [previous announcement][1.24.0] then in brief, 1.24
introduces better support for low memory systems, installs itself into the Add/Remove programs
list on Windows, and now supports using `rust-toolchain.toml` files.

[1.24.0]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/04/27/Rustup-1.24.0.html

Shortly after publishing the 1.24.0 release of Rustup, we got reports of [a regression][2737]
preventing users from running `rustfmt` and `cargo fmt` after upgrading to
Rustup 1.24.0. To limit the damage we **reverted** the release to version
1.23.1. The only substantive change between 1.24.0 and 1.24.1 is to correct this regression.
