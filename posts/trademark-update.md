As many of you know, the Rust language trademark policy has been the subject of
an extended revision process dating back to 2022. In 2023, the Rust Foundation
released an updated draft of the policy for input following an initial survey
about community trademark priorities from the previous year along with review
by other key stakeholders, such as the Project Directors. Many members of our
community were concerned about this initial draft and shared their thoughts
through the feedback form. Since then, the Rust Foundation has continued to
engage with the Project Directors, the [Leadership Council](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/leadership-council), and the wider Rust
project (primarily via all@) for guidance on how to best incorporate as much
feedback as possible.

After extensive discussion, we are happy to circulate an updated draft with the
wider community today for final feedback. An effective trademark policy for an
open source community should reflect our collective priorities while remaining
legally sound. While the revised trademark policy cannot perfectly address
every individual perspective on this important topic, its goal is to establish
a framework to help guide appropriate use of the Rust trademark and reflect as
many common values and interests as possible. In short, this policy is designed
to steer our community toward a shared objective: to maintain and protect the
integrity of the Rust programming language.

The Leadership Council is confident that this updated version of the policy has
addressed the prevailing concerns about the initial draft and honors the
variety of voices that have contributed to its development. Thank you to those
who took the time to submit well-considered feedback for the initial draft last
year or who otherwise participated in this long-running process to update our
policy to continue to satisfy our goals.

Please review the updated Rust trademark policy [here][policy], and share
any critical concerns you might have [via this form][form] by November 20, 2024.
The Foundation has also published a [blog post][blog post] which goes into more
detail on the changes made so far. The Leadership Council and Project Directors
look forward to reviewing concerns raised and approving any final revisions
prior to an official update of the policy later this year.
