title: "Announcing Rust 1.84.0"
author: The Rust Release Team
release: true
---

The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.84.0. Rust is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via `rustup`, you can get 1.84.0 with:

```console
$ rustup update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get `rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the [detailed release notes for 1.84.0](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/releases.html#version-1840-2025-01-09).

If you'd like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel (`rustup default beta`) or the nightly channel (`rustup default nightly`). Please [report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new/choose) any bugs you might come across!

## What's in 1.84.0 stable

### Cargo can use toolchain version for library version selection

1.84.0 stabilizes the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) aware resolver,
which uses the declared [minimum supported Rust version](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/rust-version.html) from
dependencies, if available, to improve package version selection. Rust version
aware selection allows library authors to easily adopt newer Rust versions
while allowing consumers of the library to automatically use old versions
if they need compatibility with older toolchains.

Library authors should start declaring their MSRV. Previously, bumping the
version at each release to latest stable would force downstream consumers
requiring an older Rust version to avoid running `cargo update` and/or require
pinning the version of the library in use, but now those consumers will be able
to automatically avoid pulling in new library versions if they want
compatibility with an older toolchain. We expect this to provide more options
for library authors for picking their preferred support strategy for Rust
versions.

The new resolver will be enabled by default with the 2024 edition (expected to
stabilize in 1.85), but can be enabled as of 1.84 by setting
[`package.resolver = "3"`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#resolver-versions) in the Cargo.toml manifest file, or
[`resolver.incompatible-rust-versions = "fallback"`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#resolverincompatible-rust-versions) in the Cargo configuration file.

Read [the documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#rust-version) for more details.

### Migration to a new trait solver begins

The Rust compiler is in the process of moving to a new implementation for the
trait solver. The next-generation trait solver is a reimplementation of a core
component of Rust's type system. It is not only responsible for checking
whether trait-bounds - e.g. `Vec<T>: Clone` - hold, but is also used by many
other parts of the type system, such as normalization - figuring out the
underlying type of `<Vec<T> as IntoIterator>::Item` - and equating types
(checking whether T and U are the same).

In 1.84, the new solver is used for checking coherence of trait impls. At a
high level, coherence is responsible for ensuring that there is at most one
implementation of a trait for a given type, including *globally* in not yet
written or visible code in downstream crates from the current compilation.

This stabilization does include some breaking changes, primarily by fixing some
correctness issues with the old solver. Typically these will show up as new
"conflicting implementations of trait ..." errors that were not previously
reported. We expect instances of this to be rare based on evaluation of
available code through [Crater], as the soundness holes in the previous solving
engine used relatively esoteric code. It also improves our ability to detect
where impls do *not* overlap, allowing more code to be written in some cases.

For more details, see a [previous blog post](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2024/12/04/trait-system-refactor-initiative.html)
and the [stabilization report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/130654)

### Strict provenance APIs stabilized

Pointers (this includes values of reference type) in Rust have two components.

* The pointer's "address" says where in memory the pointer is currently pointing.
* The pointer's "provenance" says where and when the pointer is allowed to access memory.

In 1.84, a number of standard library functions are stabilized to permit
explicitly manipulating the address and provenance parts of pointers, avoiding
integer-to-pointer casts to side-step the inherent ambiguity of that operation.
This benefits compiler optimizations, and it is pretty much a requirement for
using tools like [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) and architectures
like [CHERI](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/) that aim
to detect and diagnose pointer misuse.

We recommend that code generally be written against the strict provenance APIs
when it needs to manipulate pointers. Rust code that doesn't cast integers to
pointers is already staying within the bounds of strict provenance, though the
usage of these APIs can make the programmer's intent clearer to tooling.

See the [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ptr/index.html#strict-provenance)
for more details on these APIs. For more background, [RFC 3559](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3559-rust-has-provenance.html)
lays out the rationale for having provenance.
